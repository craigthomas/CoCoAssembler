## What is it?

This project is an assembler for the Tandy Color Computer 1, 2 and 3 written in Python 3.6. 
It is intended to be statement compatible with any code written for the EDTASM+ assembler.
The assembler is capable of taking EDTASM+ assembly language code and translating it into
machine code for the Color Computer 1, 2, and 3. Current support is for 6809 CPU instructions,
but future enhancements will add 6309 instructions.

## Requirements

In order to run the assembler, you will need Python 3.6 or greater. If you
prefer to clone the repository, you will need Git (if you don't want to 
install Git, then check the [Releases](https://github.com/craigthomas/CoCoAssembler/releases)
section for the newest release of the package that you can download.

## License

This project makes use of an MIT style license. Please see the file called 
LICENSE for more information.

## Installing

To install the source files, download the latest release from the 
[Releases](https://github.com/craigthomas/CoCoAssembler/releases) 
section of the repository and unzip the contents in a directory of your 
choice. Or, clone the repository in the directory of your choice with:

    git clone https://github.com/craigthomas/CoCoAssembler.git

Next, you will need to install the required packages for the file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    
## Usage

To run the assembler:

    python assembler.py input_file

This will assemble the instructions found in file `input_file` and will generate
the associated Color Computer machine instructions in binary format. You will need
to save the assembled contents to a file to be useful. There are several switches
that are available:

* `--print` - prints out the assembled statements
* `--symbols` - prints out the symbol table
* `--bin_file` - save assembled contents to a binary file
* `--cas_file` - save assembled contents to a cassette file
* `--dsk_file` - save assembled contents to a virtual disk file
* `--name` - saves the program with the specified name on a cassette or virtual disk file

### Input File Format

The input file needs to follow the format below:

    LABEL    MNEMONIC    OPERANDS    COMMENT

Where:

* `LABEL` is a 10 character label for the statement
* `MNEMONIC` is a 6809 operation mnemonic from the [Mnemonic Table](#mnemonic-table) below
* `OPERANDS` are registers, values, expressions, or labels as described in the [Operands](#operands) section
* `COMMENT` is a 40 character comment describing the statement (must have a `;` preceding it)

An example file:

    # A comment line that contains nothing
    

### Print Symbol Table

To print the symbol table that is generated during assembly, use the `--symbols` 
switch:

    python assembler.py test.asm --symbols

Which will have the following output:

    -- Symbol Table --


#### Print Assembled Statements

To print out the assembled version of the program, use the `--print` switch:

    python assembler.py test.asm --print

Which will have the following output:

    -- Assembled Statements --

With this output, the first column is the offset in hex where the statement starts,
the second column contains a truncated version of the machine code generated by the
statement (truncated to 10 hex characters), the third column is the user-supplied 
label for the statement, the forth column is the mnemonic, the fifth
column is the register values of other numeric or label data the operation will
work on, and the fifth column is the comment string.


### Save to Binary File

To save the assembled contents to a binary file, use the `--bin_file` switch:

    python assembler.py test.asm --bin_file test.bin
    
The assembled program will be saved to the file `test.bin`. Note that this file
may not be useful on its own, as it does not have any meta information about
where the file should be loaded in memory. _NOTE_: If the file `test.bin` exists, 
it will be erased and overwritten.


### Save to Cassette File

To save the assembled contents to a cassette file, use the `--cas_file` switch:

    python assembler.py test.asm --cas_file test.cas
    
This will assemble the program and save it to a cassette file called `test.cas`.
The source code must include the `NAM` mnemonic to name the program (e.g. 
`NAM myprog`), or the `--name` switch must be used on the command line (e.g.
`--name myprog`). The program name on the cassette file will be `myprog`. 

**NOTE**: if the file `test.cas` exists, it will be erased and overwritten.

    
## Mnemonic Table

Below are the mnemonics that are accepted by the assembler (these mnemonics are 
compatible with EDTASM+ assembler mnemonics). For the mnemonics below, special 
symbols are:

* `A` - 8-bit accumulator register.
* `B` - 8-bit accumulator register.
* `CC` - 8-bit condition code register.
* `D` - 16-bit accumulator register comprised of A and B, with A being high byte, and B being low byte.
* `M` - a memory location with a value between 0 and 65535.
* `S` - 16-bit system stack register.
* `U` - 16-bit user stack register.
* `X` - 16-bit index register.
* `Y` - 16-bit index register.
 
### Mnemonics

| Mnemonic | Description | Example |

| `ASLA`   | Shifts bits in `A` left (0 placed in bit 0, bit 7 goes to carry in `CC`).  | `ASLA`                 |
| `ASLB`   | Shifts bits in `B` left (0 placed in bit 0, bit 7 goes to carry in `CC`).  | `ASLB`                 |

| `ASR`    | Shifts bits in `M` right (bit 0 goes to carry in `CC`, bit 7 remains same).| `ASR $0E00`            |


### Pseudo Operations

| Mnemonic | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `FCB`    | Defines a single byte constant value.                                      | `FCB $1C`              |
| `FCC`    | Defines a string constant value enclosed in a matching pair of delimiters. | `FCC "hello"`          |
| `FDB`    | Defines a two byte constant value.                                         | `FDB $2000`            |
| `END`    | Defines the end of the program.                                            | `END`                  |
| `EQU`    | Defines a symbol with a set value.                                         | `SCRMEM EQU $1000`     |
| `INCLUDE`| Includes another assembly source file at this location.                    | `INCLUDE globals.asm`  |
| `NAM`    | Sets the name for the program when assembled to disk or cassette.          | `NAM myprog`           |
| `ORG`    | Defines where in memory the program should originate at.                   | `ORG $0E00`            |
| `SETDP`  | Sets the direct page value for the assembler (see notes below).            | `SETDP $0E00`          |

**Notes**

* `SETDP` - this mnemonic is used for memory and instruction optimization by the assembler. For example, 
if `SETDP $0E00` is set, any machine instructions that use `$0EXX` as a memory location will be assembled 
using direct page addressing. Instructions such as `JMP $0E8F` will become `JMP <$8F`. The programmer is 
responsible for loading the direct page register manually - this mnemonic does not output opcodes that
change the direct page register.
